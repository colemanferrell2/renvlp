  abstract = {Envelope models and methods represent new constructions that can lead to substantial increases in estimation efficiency in multivariate analyses. The envlp toolbox implements a variety of envelope estimators under the framework of multivariate linear regression, including the envelope model, partial envelope model, heteroscedastic envelope model, inner envelope model, scaled envelope model, and envelope model in the predictor space. The toolbox also implements the envelope model for estimating a multivariate mean. The capabilities of this toolbox include estimation of the model parameters, as well as performing standard multivariate inference in the context of envelope models; for example, prediction and prediction errors, F test for two nested models, the standard errors for contrasts or linear combinations of coefficients, and more. Examples and datasets are contained in the toolbox to illustrate the use of each model. All functions and datasets are documented.},

Our approach is based on the construction of a link between the mean function and the covariance matrix, using the minimal reducing subspace of the latter that accommodates the former. This leads to a multivariate regression model that we call the envelope model, where the number of parameters is maximally reduced. The MLE from the envelope model can be substantially less variable than the usual MLE, especially when the mean function varies in directions that are orthogonal to the directions of maximum variation for the covariance matrix.},

  abstract = {Motivated by searching for associations between genetic variants and brain imaging phenotypes, the aim of this article is to develop a groupwise envelope model for multivariate linear regression in order to establish the association between both multivariate responses and covariates. The groupwise envelope model allows for both distinct regression coefficients and distinct error structures for different groups. Statistically, the proposed envelope model can dramatically improve efficiency of tests and of estimation. Theoretical properties of the proposed model are established. Numerical experiments as well as the analysis of an imaging genetic data set obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study show the effectiveness of the model in efficient estimation. Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.},
